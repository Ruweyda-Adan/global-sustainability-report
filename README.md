## üåç Global Sustainability Report
Welcome to the Global Sustainability Report repository!
This project dives into the world of corporate sustainability through structured data analysis using SQL, Excel, and Power BI. The goal is to uncover environmental, social, and governance (ESG) trends across industries and regions ‚Äî bringing insights to life with impactful dashboards.

## Objective
The primary aim of this project was to clean, transform, and analyze ESG-related corporate data using Excel and SQL, then visualize the findings through an interactive Power BI dashboard. From carbon emissions and water usage to governance scores and growth rates, the analysis delivers a comprehensive view of corporate sustainability performance.

## Chapters
## Chapter 1: Data Preparation & Cleaning
Utilized Excel to perform initial cleanup, restructuring columns and converting data types.

Ensured consistency in units (e.g., standardizing emissions and consumption metrics).

Prepared the dataset for seamless SQL import and analysis.

## Chapter 2: ESG SQL Queries
Employed MySQL Workbench to:

Import and explore the dataset.

Write and execute SQL queries for aggregate ESG metrics.

Generate industry-specific and region-based sustainability insights.

Key SQL operations used:

SELECT, GROUP BY, SUM, AND ORDER BY

## Chapter 3: Interactive Power BI Dashboard
Built dynamic dashboards with filters for:

Region, Industry, and Year.

Visualized key metrics:

Total carbon emissions, ESG scores, water and energy usage.

Designed visual comparisons:

ESG trends by region, industry, and time period.

Year-on-year carbon emission trends across sectors.

##  Key Insights
Energy consumption and carbon emissions show higher concentrations in manufacturing and energy-intensive industries.

Retail and tech industries exhibit stronger ESG governance scores, suggesting a greater focus on compliance and leadership structures.

Latin America and Europe emerged as regions with growing sustainability efforts, showing improving ESG Environmental scores year over year.

A positive growth rate correlation is observable in companies with balanced ESG efforts.
