#  Global Sustainability Report

Welcome to the **Global Sustainability Report** repository

This project analyzes corporate ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) performance across industries and regions. By combining data cleaning in **Excel**, querying in **MySQL**, and storytelling with **Power BI**, it uncovers key insights into corporate sustainability efforts — a growing priority in today’s business world.


## Project Summary

This project simulates the real-world analysis a sustainability or business intelligence analyst might conduct. Using an ESG dataset of companies worldwide, it explores:

- How ESG scores vary across industries and regions  
- Which sectors are performing well or poorly in sustainability  
- What trends emerge in carbon emissions, water usage, governance, and profitability  

The final product is an **interactive Power BI dashboard** and a **collection of reusable SQL queries** that highlight high- and low-performing sectors, helping stakeholders make data-informed decisions.

## Objective

> To clean, analyze, and visualize ESG-related corporate data in order to derive **actionable sustainability insights** using Excel, MySQL Workbench, and Power BI.

## Chapters

### Chapter 1: Data Preparation & Cleaning (Excel)
- Handled messy data formatting and inconsistent column naming
- Standardized units for carbon emissions, water usage, and energy consumption
- Restructured the dataset for SQL import

### Chapter 2: ESG SQL Queries (MySQL Workbench)
Performed analytical queries such as:

- **Total energy consumption** by region and industry
- **Water usage** and **environmental scores** by industry
- Carbon emissions comparison vs. profitability
- Growth trends of companies with high ESG ratings

**Key SQL Concepts Used**:  
`SELECT`, `GROUP BY`, `SUM`, AND `ORDER BY`.

### Chapter 3: Interactive Power BI Dashboard
Created a professional, interactive report showing:

- ESG trends over time
- Carbon and energy use by sector
- Regional comparisons for all three ESG pillars
- ESG score breakdown by industry and year
- Growth rate overlays for profitable, sustainable firms

## Key Insights

 **Strengths Found:**
- European companies show strong governance frameworks  
- Retail and tech industries excel in ESG governance  
- Balanced ESG efforts often align with **positive growth rates**  

 **Problems Identified:**
- High energy consumption in manufacturing and mining industries  
- Carbon emissions remain high in some profitable companies  
- Environmental scores lag in certain regions and sectors

 **Solutions Suggested:**
- Encourage energy-efficient upgrades in high-consumption industries  
- Offer tax incentives for companies improving ESG metrics  
- Benchmark leaders to help underperformers catch up
